# Codex Review Brief: Core Engine Implementation

## Your Task
Review the core engine implementation completed by Claude for the Agent Foundry project. Your goal is to verify the code quality, accuracy, and completeness of the foundational modules.

## Repository Location
- GitHub: https://github.com/CryptoJym/agent-foundry
- Branch: main

## Files to Review

### 1. Model Schema (`src/core/schema.py`)
- Verify the ModelSchema dataclass covers all necessary model attributes
- Check that validation logic is comprehensive
- Ensure serialization/deserialization works correctly
- Confirm the migration script properly handles legacy formats

### 2. VRAM Calculator (`src/core/vram.py`)
- Validate the mathematical calculations for:
  - Weight memory (with quantization)
  - KV cache memory (with grouped-query attention)
  - Activation memory
- Check the GPU recommendation logic
- Verify the optimization algorithm for fitting within constraints

### 3. Latency Estimator (`src/core/latency.py`)
- Review the prefill time calculations
- Verify decode time estimations
- Check hardware multipliers are reasonable
- Validate the network latency considerations

### 4. Model Scoring (`src/core/scoring.py`)
- Verify the weighted scoring algorithm (40% task, 15% context, etc.)
- Check task-to-specialization mappings
- Review the ranking logic
- Ensure recommendation reports are useful

## Review Checklist

### Code Quality
- [ ] All functions have proper docstrings
- [ ] Type hints are used consistently
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] Code follows Python best practices

### Functionality
- [ ] VRAM calculations match known benchmarks
- [ ] Latency estimates are realistic
- [ ] Scoring algorithm produces sensible rankings
- [ ] All modules integrate properly via `__init__.py`

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Handles missing/invalid model data gracefully
- [ ] Works with both dense and MoE architectures
- [ ] Quantization calculations are accurate
- [ ] Scoring works with partial criteria

### Testing
- [ ] Each module has test examples in `__main__`
- [ ] Edge cases are considered
- [ ] Integration points are tested

## Expected Output
Please provide:
1. Overall assessment (PASS/FAIL)
2. Any bugs or issues found
3. Suggestions for improvements
4. Confirmation that the foundation is solid for UI development

## Next Steps
Once you confirm the core engines are solid, we'll proceed with parallel UI development across multiple Codex instances.
